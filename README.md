# React - Gallery of My Life

Description: A React CRUD app that allows a user to input their own image from a url (or add an image to the project if they have access) and provide a description to match the image for better accessability. Each image in the gallery has a like counter for others to view and 'like' as well as a remove function for images that the user does not want on the gallery anymore.
